Further, when the mixing results from shear turbulence rather than thermal mixing this parameter is not useful for glider flying. NB: this BL Top is not the height where the Thermal Index (TI) is zero, which is a criteria used by many simple determinations of the BL top - instead, the RASP BL Top uses a more sophisticated BL Top criteria based on turbulent fluxes"

Larger values indicate greater uncertainty/variability and thus better thermalling over local 'hot spots' or small-scale topography not resolved by the model. But larger values also indicate greater sensitivity to error in the predicted surface temperature, so actual conditions have a greater likelihood of differing from those predicted. Small values often result from the presence of a stable (inversion) layer capping and limiting thermal growth. This parameter is most easily utilized through relative values, i.e. by first determining a 'typical' value for a location and subsequently noting whether predictions for a given day are for more/less uncertainty than is typical"
